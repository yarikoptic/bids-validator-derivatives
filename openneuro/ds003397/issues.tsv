error	JSON_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR	Invalid JSON sidecar file. The sidecar is not formatted according the schema.	SliceTiming	30	10
error	NOT_INCLUDED	Files with such naming scheme are not part of BIDS specification. This error is most commonly caused by typos in file names that make them not BIDS compatible. Please consult the specification and make sure your files are named correctly. If this is not a file naming issue (for example when including files not yet covered by the BIDS specification) you should include a ".bidsignore" file in your dataset (see https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator#bidsignore for details). Please note that derived (processed) data should be placed in /derivatives folder and source data (such as DICOMS or behavioural logs in proprietary formats) should be placed in the /sourcedata folder.		31	15

warning	B0_FIELD_IDENTIFIER_RECOMMENDED	File is missing B0FieldIdentifier metadata and IntendedFor metadata, so it will not be possible to use to perform susceptibility distortion correction. B0FieldIdentifier metadata permits the flexible selection of images for estimating B0 inhomogeneity fields, and B0FieldSource permits EPI images to indicate the identifier of the estimated field to use.
